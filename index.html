<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi There!</h1>
<p>My name is Aditya Sathish and welcome to my little home on the internet.</p>
<p>I am a Masters student at Virginia Tech and also a Graduate Research Assistant at the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative at Arlington, Virginia, USA under Dr. Aloizio Pereira Da Silva.</p>
<p>My primary interests lie in the area of wireless communications and networks. Before going back to school, I was in the industry for almost 5 years, working on developing the system software for next-generation Wi-Fi access points - helping my team implement 3 generations of Wi-Fi standards on cutting edge hardware. Check out some of the things I did <a href="#projects">below</a>!.</p>
<p>As part of my thesis, I am trying to solve problems relating to the O-RAN architecture for 5G-and-beyond open and intelligent cellular mobile networks.</p>

          <br>
          In August 2022, I joined Dr. Aloizio Pereira Da Silva's xG (Next-G) testbed lab at the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative to work on research to solve the challenges relating to open and intelligent radio access networks.

          As part of the Open RAN architecture, software-defined networking, cloud virtualization, machine learning and common off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware play a major role in reshaping the landscape for celluar base stations.
