<h1>Hi There! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>My name is Aditya Sathish and welcome to my little home on the internet.</p>
<p>I am a Masters student of Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech and also a Graduate Research Assistant at the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative at Arlington, Virginia, USA under Dr. Aloizio Pereira Da Silva.</p>
<p>My primary interests lie in the area of wireless communications and networks. Before going back to school, I was in the industry for almost 5 years, working on developing the system software for next-generation Wi-Fi access points - helping my team implement 3 generations of Wi-Fi standards on cutting edge hardware. Check out some of the things I did <a href="#projects">below</a>!.</p>
<p>As part of my thesis, I am trying to solve problems relating to the O-RAN architecture for 5G-and-beyond (5G/B5G) open and intelligent cellular mobile networks.</p>

          In August 2022, I moved to the US to join Dr. Aloizio Pereira Da Silva's xG (Next-G) testbed lab at the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative to research on open and intelligent radio access networks. Alongside my research, I am also working towards my Masters degree in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech.

          As part of the Open RAN architecture, software-defined networking, cloud virtualization, machine learning and common off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware play a major role in reshaping the landscape for celluar base stations - allowing academic researchers (like myself) a key to a playing field that was previously restricted to technology industries only.

          <b class="bolder">Senior System Software Engineer</b>
          <br>
          <i>Qualcomm Incorporated</i> - Bengaluru, KA, India
          <br>
          August 2017 to July 2022
          <br>
          <br>
          After completing my undergrad at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka and having had a touch of experience in Wi-Fi through my final-year project, I was incredibly keen to start working in the domain of wireless networks and systems. I joined Qualcomm's Bangalore Development Center to work on the company's next-generation IEEE 802.11 (or Wi-Fi) access point software.
          <br>
          <br>
          While at Qualcomm, I worked all through the L2/MAC layer of IEEE 802.11 driver development including the application layer (including hostapd and other userspace apps for driver configuration through cfg80211 and WEXT), kernel space (which is where most of my driver development work resided in) and the hardware-software interface at the firmware level.
          <br>
          <br>
          I implemented and/or enhanced various features of the 802.11 specification such as: <i>Automatic Channel Selection</i>, <i>Dynamic Channel Management</i>, <i>Scanning</i>, <i>Enhanced MBSSID</i>,  <i>Automatic Frequency Coordination (AFC)</i>, <i>802.11be PPDU preamble puncturing</i> and <i>802.11be multi-link operation</i>. At the end of my career at Qualcomm, I was maintaining all the channel management features including the AFC channel selection algorithm.

          <b class="bolder">Summer Research Intern</b>
          <br>
          <i>Indian Institute of Science</i> - Bengaluru, KA, India
          <br>
          May 2016 to July 2016
          <br>
          <br>
          In the summer of 2016, I was 1 out of 4 undergraduate students selected for a summer research internship program in High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) at the Supercomputer Education and Research Center (SERC) located at the prestigious Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru, KA.
          <br>
          <br>
          I worked with Dr. Matthew Jacob Thazhuthaveetil's team to identify similar sequences in the execution flow of large-scale programs like the GNU GCC compiler. We used data points like cache hits/misses counters, instructions-per-cycle (IPC) counters in discretized blocks of the total instruction trace. The data points were then fed to a regression tree algorithm to identify clusters of code which had similar data points. The clusters can then be utilized with compiler optimization techniques to improve resource utilization of the computer.
          <br>
          <br>
          Alongside the research internship, I also participated in a summer school program to learn about advanced computer architecture and GPGPU programming using different languages like NVIDIA CUDA, OpenMP and MPI. We also got a chance to use some cool tools like DRAMSim and SimpleScalar which made the job of analyzing the behavior of computer microarchitecture much easier for me.
