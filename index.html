<h1>Hi there!</h1>
<p>My name is Aditya Sathish and welcome to my little home on the internet.</p>
<p>I am a Masters student at Virginia Tech and also a Graduate Research Assistant at the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative at Arlington, Virginia, USA under Dr. Aloizio Pereira Da Silva.</p>
<p>My primary interests lie in the area of wireless communications and networks. Before going back to school, I was in the industry for almost 5 years, working on developing the system software for next-generation Wi-Fi access points - helping my team implement 3 generations of Wi-Fi standards on cutting edge hardware. Check out some of the things I did <a href="#projects">below</a>!.</p>
<p>Now I am spending my time trying to solve problems relating to the adoption of the O-RAN architecture for 5G-and-beyond open and intelligent cellular mobile networks.</p>
