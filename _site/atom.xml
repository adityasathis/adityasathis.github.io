   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, this is my blog. I know there isn’t much over here. I’m still trying to figure out if I should just upload here (where I don’t have a viewership) or get a platform on Medium (where I also don’t have a viewership but it’s sort of easier) or just continue on at WordPress. Either way, there will be a feed over here for me to keep track of my creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of viewership is secondary. The primary goal is to curate all content that I have generated in my lifetime here so I can look back one day and feel like I contributed something to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more updates!&lt;/p&gt;
