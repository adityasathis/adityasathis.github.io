# Introduction
This repository contains the source code to my personal website.

It currently uses the Hyde theme running on Jekyll. I found it to be extremely easy to set it up and it took much less time to setup compared to writing code for Bootstrap/CSS, HTML and JS on my own. I used to have time to build websites as a kid but age always plays a tricky hand.

Oh well, I'm glad I got used to Hyde. There were a few things that I had to fix which I hope the commits will be clear about.
